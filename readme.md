# Turing Code Challenge Training

I'm gathering information about this test and studying because I want to pass.

So I decided to make this public so other people can see some examples about how to (or how not to) do the tests...
And also various test examples to study for the Turing test.

## Important Information
As this is a study to pass in a test with 2 code-challenges in 30min, I'm not hooked on details or execution time, I'm full focused on functionality here.
If this works and is slow, it's better than not working.

I like to use JAVA because it's a well organized high-language, but for most of this code-challenges JS seems easier to work-with quickier.
